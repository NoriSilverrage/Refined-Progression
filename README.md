# Refined-Progression
Contract Pack for Kerbal Space Program

A set of contracts to give a different sense of progression in the game.
I've specifically designed it to be work with as many planet packs as possible.

Currently there are 16 contracts. The first 9 are the basic progression contracts bringing you up to escaping the Homeworld.
The next 3 are a set of contracts to perform fly by, orbit and landing of either the Homeworld's moons, or the Homeworld's parent's moons.

So for instance, if you are playing stock Kerbol system you would get a Fly By of either the Mun or Minmus. If you are playing Real Solar System you should get a Moon Fly By.
If you are playing New Horizon you would get Mun, Aptur or Serran Fly Bys.

The last 4 contracts are repeatable contracts that vary in form and use.
